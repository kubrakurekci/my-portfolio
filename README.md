## 🚀 Personal Portfolio Website

I published my personal portfolio website, where I focused on building a component-based structure using modern frontend tools. Throughout the process, I aimed to improve both performance and maintainability while strengthening my practical skills.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- Vite – Fast development and build process  
- React – Reusable component-based architecture  
- DaisyUI & Material UI – UI components and design system  
- GSAP – Smooth and engaging animations  

### 📂 Project Structure
Instead of hardcoding content inside components, I stored the data in a central JSON file and dynamically rendered it by mapping through the data. This made the project more organized, scalable, and easier to manage.

### 💡 Notes
While building this project, I spent a lot of time experimenting with GitHub workflows and fine-tuning animations using GSAP. It was a challenging but very educational process that helped me grow as a developer.

This project is still evolving — I’ll continue updating it as I build new projects and learn new technologies.
